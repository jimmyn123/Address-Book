# AddressBook
This is a quick program that has three classes and one interface.
Two different types of implementations for an AddressBook are used.
One class implements the AddressBook using a binary search tree.
The other uses hashing and hash buckets.
The third class tests all the functions of each implementation of the AddressBook.
